Objective:  getting acquainted

Points: 12

Description:

1) login to your CS account and send email to dunigan@cs.utk.edu
   In the message tell me a bit about your computing background
   (do you have a PC, what OS's do you run, type of Internet connection
    you use, favorite programming language...),
   interests and hobbies, and anything special you'd like to see
   covered in the course. (Please don't disclose any information
   that might be used against you in a court of law!)

2) Rate your UNIX abilities ( ;-) ) according to the somewhat dated
   criteria in 
       http://www.cs.utk.edu/~dunigan/ipp05/wiz.txt

3) What email address should I use for you regarding class announcements?

4) Cruise the Internet, find a typical price for the following PC
   components:
      a)  56kb modem card
      b) 10/100T ethernet card
      c) GigE ethernet card
      d) cable (or DLS) NAT/router/firewall/wireless-basestation combo

5) Telnet is a useful tool for checking out what network services
   are running on a target machine, e.g.  telnet host portnumber
   You can break out of a telnet connection using the escape
   sequence (usually  ctrl-]) and then type quit. 
   From one of the CS hosts, use the telnet command to determine what
   service (if any) is running for each of the following host-port pairs.

       target host         port      hints
   a) cetus1.cs.utk.edu     22         secret
   b) 160.91.4.30           80         try typing  "get bob"
   c) 160.36.56.221         25
   d) whisper.cs.utk.edu   995    
   e) yomega.cs.utk.edu    995    
   f) whisper.cs.utk.edu  7777         try typing something,
				       and then type what it replies
   9) 160.91.212.75         23         check your watch, how many seconds 
				       before telnet "times out", be patient
				       or use the time command:
					time telnet 160.91.212.75

   A handy way to report results would be to "paste" the output
   of each test along with your interpretation of what
   service is being provided.
   For the above telnet tests, please indicate the date and time
   that you started the sequence of tests and the OS and IP address
   of the machine from which you were issuing the telnet's. 

6) What info do you find in the file   /etc/services

email your answers to dunigan@cs.utk.edu  as a simple plain text file
(no PDF's, DOC files, or funky attachments).
