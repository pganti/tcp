<P>What do those wild, crazy, fun-lovin' computer programmers do on Friday 
nights? Play the TCP/IP drinking game, of course! </P>
<P>I'm collecting questions for the TCP/IP drinking game. Send me a TCP/IP or 
general networking question and if I like your question, I'll include it and 
give you credit. Send your questions to val at nmt dot edu. </P>
<P>You can play the TCP/IP drinking game just about any way you want, as long as 
you remember that the point is to have fun laughing at the bizarre questions 
which no human being actually knows the answers to. The way I usually play it is 
like this: Pass the cards around in a circle. Each person asks a question of the 
person next in line. If you get the wrong answer, drink to punish yourself. If 
you get the right answer, drink to celebrate. If it was a particularly good 
question, everyone drinks. Remember, nobody wins a drinking game. </P>
<P>Notes on new submissions: Funny questions are best! If you can, please 
include a reference or two showing why your answer is correct. Otherwise, I 
might not have the time to research it myself for a few weeks and your question 
won't show up as quickly as it might. Also, make sure you include the name you 
would like to see in the "Credit" field for that question. Keep the excellent 
questions coming! </P>

  <LI><B>Q: What two ICMP types should never be blocked? </B>
  <LI>A: ICMP type 3, Destination Unreachable, especially code 4, "fragmentation 
  needed but don't fragment bit set" (necessary for path MTU discovery) and ICMP

  get replies).

  <LI><B>Q: What is the typical MTU for an RFC 1149 transmission? </B>
  <LI>A: From RFC 1149, Carrier Pigeon Internet Protocol: "The MTU is variable, 
  and paradoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age. A typicall 
  MTU is 256 milligrams"

  <LI><B>Q: What data link layer algorithm is described by an "algorhyme" in the 
  original paper? Extra credit for reciting the first two lines. </B>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Q: What is the minimum length of an Ethernet packet, and why is there a

  <LI>Credit: Ted T'so </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Q: What is the 'Stretch ACK violation' documented in RFC 2525? </B>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Q: What feature of IP is central to most traceroute implementations? 
  </B>
  <LI>A: The TTL (Time To Live) field. Most traceroutes send packets with 
  artificially small TTLs and use the ICMP Time Exceeded responses from 
  intermediate hosts to trace the route to a host. 
  <LI>Credit: Warren Postma </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Q: Why was traceroute originally implemented using UDP packets rather 
  than ICMP echo requests? </B>
  <LI>A: In 1988, many TCP/IP stacks didn't return ICMP Time Exceeded responses 
  to ICMP packets, but would for UDP packets.

<UL>
  <LI><B>Q: What is RED, Random Early Detection? </B>

  <LI><B>Q: What is silly window syndrome? </B>
  <LI>A: In TCP, when the receiving end continually advertises a tiny window, 
  resulting in data being sent in very small packets.

  <LI><B>Q: If the remote host of a TCP connection does not advertise an MSS, 
  what is the assumed MSS? </B>
  <LI>A: 536 bytes over IPv4, 1220 over IPv6, although most implementations 
  default to 512 and 1024 respectively.

  <LI><B>Q: Name three methods or algorithms related to congestion control in 
  TCP. </B>
  <LI>A: Congestion window, Vegas, Reno, NewReno, SACK, DSACK, FACK, Eifel 
  algorithm, ECN, RTO

  <LI><B>Q: The ECN field uses which bits in the byte that contains the IPv4 TOS 
  field? </B>
  <LI>A: Bits 6 and 7.

  <LI><B>Q: What's wrong with the standard way of estimating RTO (Retransmission 
  TimeOut)? </B>
  <LI>A: It places too much weight on the variance of round trip times.

  <LI><B>Q: The IPv4 fields formerly known as TOS (Type Of Service) and 
  precedence are now called what? </B>
  <LI>A: The DS (Differentiated Services) and ECN (Explicit Congestion 
  Notification) fields.

  <LI><B>Q: Why do most traceroute implementations NOT use the IP Record Route 
  option to find intermediate hosts? </B>
  <LI>A: The IP Record Route option can only record 9 intermediate hosts, which 
  is too few for many routes in the modern Internet.
